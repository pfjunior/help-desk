# HelpDesk

This project is inspired by my final college project. Originally it was developed in php\*. No ideas to develop a project to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the courses. I decided to create a simpler version of my college project.
The idea of the project is to help the IT department that works with user support. With the HelpDesk, the support team has control of the services with the opening of tickets.

> Programming language learned in college. I never worked professionally with her. Well, I chose C# as the language to work with.
